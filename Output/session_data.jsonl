When you are able to break free from your constructed reality, you see that the door was open the entire time. Now you have to step through it.So, Eric, you've experienced the full journey of a worksheet and you witnessed the facilitation. Now this is self facilitation, and I noticed that you had filled it in. So what was that process? Did you pull one out of your head or from your from the judge your neighbor worksheet onto this one?"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: It was around financial security.", "completion": "Chedy: Excellent. Okay. So, what was the the thought you isolated from the judge your neighbor worksheet and move to this one belief at a time worksheet?"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: Is it true? No.", "completion": "Chedy: So, what is it you don't have enough money? Yes. Okay, so you don't have enough money. And what did you find? That you sell facilitate"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: The situation was I feel incapable. When I feel like I don't have enough money and then the emotions that arose with distress, shame, low self worth, inability to survive inability to thrive.", "completion": "Chedy: So what happened? You're one of the few people in the entire world that don't believe they need more moneyWhat did you discover? Oh, no, some of us we drop into a depth and we see it's crazy. But it doesn't stop us from wanting more money. So it's, we begin to open to know and then how do you react in that third question when you believe that thought you don't need more money? So it begins to open up the experience of cause and effect, believe suffer, or believe don't suffer? And we get to see what is true for you ultimately, and how you're going to wear it in the world.

And we are convinced now to go more deeply into the way you answered this. Something happens for you to be fearful. When you believe the thought you need more money and you experience what you just described. You see images of past you see images of future remember the movie I was talking about? It's how the mind reacts when it believes the thought. Now you cannot be fearful. If you're not believing what you're seeing in this dream world have not know it's terrifying. So it simply means that egos got you. So let's look at in this moment, you need more money. Is it true? No, no, there's there's there's nothing even for sale here. It's just not true. And if and so just now we're looking at just No. No, notice how you react when you believe that thought you need more money. And we've seen that and so those images of past future what do you see"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: It's, it's like it keeps cycling back to the past. The energy keeps getting bold, not", "completion": "Chedy: Yeah. And those who are images of the past may come from movies they come from from parents stories. They come from grandparents stories that come from neighbors stories. And we watch them we've seen them. And it doesn't matter if it's happened to us or not. It's traumatizing. In other words, the egos caught us in that that dream now and then you see images of the future and what do you see?"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: I don't need more money.", "completion": "Chedy: becoming your future. And now, when you are questioning what you're believing the past begins to lose its power. So there's nothing to create a future and that leaves you present. You need more money just here right now. Is that true? Are we producing? No. And so I need more money, turn it around. What's the opposite? I don't"}

And you don't have any money. So now you're in the store, you're watching them, buy all this stuff. They have the money, okay? You don't. Okay? Now let's call that right here right now. So be there now. You need more money."}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: I don't need more money feels better. than spending money I don't know. Well", "completion": "Chedy: We should be without your story. Look at their joy. Look at their laughter just become a part and just be a part of all of that. Continue to witness I don't need more money. Now what feels better that are spending money you really don't have."}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: there's no poverty when you're joining people in the way you described.", "completion": "Chedy: you don't miss anything you gain look how busy they are. And look at the competition and everything from joy to surely should know it's all there to witness just for you. That's how I see live. That's how I see life. I don't have to join people I join people. I see"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: doesn't sit anywhere.", "completion": "Chedy: Now move back into I need more money look at the different doesn't,"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: yeah", "completion": "Chedy: Now I invite I invite everyone to find an exception. In other words, a moment in time where you need more money. It does doesn't happen.

It's just just notice that Where are you the most empowered with a thought or without. And it's not as though you don't know how to make money. It's not as though you can't"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: the hardest part was the full willingness to be honest with myself in a public space. So humiliation was like the first obstacle had to overcome and stigma and shame and all of the things around sharing what's difficult for me. That was and then I kind of moved through it and wanted to be with experience to do it to be deliberated, essentially, you know, stronger than the desire to remain. Keep the facade", "completion": "Chedy: know the question is Are you okay? If they take your house they take your car, they take everything without the cut. They need more money. Are you okay? So imagine yourself sitting on the curb and you're watching two people move into your house, the house you loved and they're moving in and they're late love it and you don't even have money for a hotel room. Sitting there. Watch the joy witness the joy and moving in. Yeah. So it's okay to be homeless to anyone I love the world to know that other than what we're thinking and believing. It doesn't matter what terror we're experiencing. Like if someone's got a knife and they you know, they say I'm going to kill you. And I'm going to kill you like they really mean it. Am I okay in that moment? Am I okay? Here's how I'm not okay. If I imagine the future even one nanosecond and imagine it goes hand and what created the fear the knife? The words, or my anticipation of that nanosecond who frightened me was it what was it the person with the knife? Did I do that? Myself? We're not doing this on purpose. But to wake up to reality leaves us in the fear just another way of saying look to yourself. There's nothing terrible has ever happened. Never will happen. It's all this work. will bring you into a kind of stillness. If you bring it into your practice your meditative practice, a kind of stillness and Stephen and I were laughing the other day. We were in London and on and one of those huge buses was coming. And the streets were just we just crowded. And I stepped out onto the street. And everyone was literally gasping and oh my god, oh my god and so fearful there was no danger whatsoever because I'm not crazy. So imagine if I had anticipated the bus what could have happened? Fear would just I wouldn't know where to go. I would just like lean back and enjoy the wind. It was heavenly. So this practice can give you a present that is really user friendly. And where other people are lost you can be seen or make poor decisions when we're fearful. So that went from money to a lot of things didn't. So what did you like about it? Or what did you find confusing or when you were sitting alone with your one belief"}

Yeah.", "completion": "Chedy: being said you have a sense of where you're going who's one just move through the fear any anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: Thank you.No thank you.", "completion": "Chedy: So people would call that courage. Thank you. Aaron."}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: this is about a past relationship. And the belief is he's trying to control me. Okay,", "completion": "Chedy: So hello, Laurie, and welcome to the show. And what is your topic? What is your concept? Yeah,"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: The situation is we finished a reception wedding reception, and he caught me smoking a cigarette, my friends. He's very upset by it. So we came home in the kitchen having an argument, and I felt like he was trying to control me.", "completion": "Chedy: and what is the situation?"}

{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: are very defensive and go to extremes and then start to shut down", "completion": "Chedy: Okay. So he's trying to control you. Is that true? Now the only way you're going to understand the the how to answer this. At the level you deserve, is to witness yourself in the kitchen with him in the situation. And really as closely as you can look at his facial look at his look at his attitude. And hear the words and look closely and maybe it's not what you believed at the time. Maybe you see something different. Maybe you don't. He's trying to control you. Is it true? Yes. And how do you react? Witness in your mind's eye? How you react when you believe the thought? He's trying to control you?"}

Yeah, he was much more open.", "completion": "Chedy: and in witness your physical mannerisms and patterns and get in touch with see like from outside of you yourself? Yeah, yeah. So that's very rich to get a glimpse of yourself like that. Because when you get in touch with those tendencies through meditating, they're like, like we're doing. They start to show you when you're, they start to show you you from an experiential place in your life as opposed to having to live through those things that that you may feel guilt over. So it's just been in touch with how you react when you believe the thought and what happens. He's trying to control you. Okay, so close your eyes and look at him. See him just the way it was. Now dry you have a posted on him. It was a sticky posted. Yeah, he's trying to control you right now. Take that posted off. And just who are you without your story? Look at him, hear him. And who are you with? That thought he's trying to control you. What do you see?"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: Yeah. starting to make sense. Yeah.", "completion": "Chedy: So there's that thing. You are who I believe you to be in the I am who I believe you to be in the moment. I believe it"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: I'm trying to control him.", "completion": "Chedy: So he's trying to control me turn it around. I'm,"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: on. Yeah, I can see that. Even when I was reacting back to him, this you know, this isn't going to work. Maybe Maybe we should end this I kind of knew that was my way of manipulating him. Yeah. I thought though again, the back I dropped the kind of I knew that was", "completion": "Chedy: So try that"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: Surrender came to mind, but I can't fit that into the sentence. Allow me", "completion": "Chedy: we were up to our trips. We kind of skip over them very quickly, because he's controlling me after all. Yeah. Trying to good luck with that. Yes, so he's trying to control you what is the opposite of control?"}

{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: right? Yeah. Yeah, and the way that he wanted to have a conversation about it,that he actually didn't jump to any conclusions. I was actually at my friend's wedding and reception and we were probably at some of the last people leave", "completion": "Chedy: Cuz you see how you are"}

Hearing it differently. Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: It makes me want to distance myself from those people.", "completion": "Chedy: It's possible for someone to control you Is it true? No.And how do you react what happens when you believe the thought it's possible for someone to control you?"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: Yeah, much more open and receptive to people in general.", "completion": "Chedy: Those controlling people and who would you be without the thought? It's possible for someone to control you. Just living your life the rest of your life without the thought"}

{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: Yeah, it really is.", "completion": "Chedy: But it's always been correct. Can you find one time in your life when anyone has ever controlled up now? Not really. And I challenge everyone watching this or all of you in the room. I sure did believe it though. For a long time if someone if someone says button can you drop your hand or I'm going to shoot you? You know your choice that's a Yeah, it's my choice. It's poor attempt the mic drop my hand and see what happens but there's no guarantee there either. So manipulation just becomes an old overused standard."}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: No.", "completion": "Chedy: Painful to both parties. Yeah. If he said if you don't drop your hand, I'm going to kill you. And I dropped my hand. Did he control me?"}
{"prompt": "Unknown Speaker: Thank you. See me?", "completion": "Chedy: I made the choice to drop their hands. So why would I blame him for killing me which I couldn't anyway. Thank you, Laurie. Thank you, fun to sit with you. And very empowering"}
