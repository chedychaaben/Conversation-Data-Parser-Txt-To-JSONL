Chedy  
So hello, Laurie, and welcome to the show. And what is your topic? What is your concept? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  
this is about a past relationship. And the belief is he's trying to control me. Okay,

Chedy  
and what is the situation?

Unknown Speaker  
The situation is we finished a reception wedding reception, and he caught me smoking a cigarette, my friends. He's very upset by it. So we came home in the kitchen having an argument, and I felt like he was trying to control me.

Chedy  
So he's trying to control you. Is it true? What is it he doesn't want you to smoke? Is that the thing

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah. Fall into bad habits with my friends.

Chedy  
Okay. So he's trying to control you. Is that true? Now the only way you're going to understand the the how to answer this. At the level you deserve, is to witness yourself in the kitchen with him in the situation. And really as closely as you can look at his facial look at his look at his attitude. And hear the words and look closely and maybe it's not what you believed at the time. Maybe you see something different. Maybe you don't. He's trying to control you. Is it true? Yes. And how do you react? Witness in your mind's eye? How you react when you believe the thought? He's trying to control you?

Unknown Speaker  
are very defensive and go to extremes and then start to shut down

Chedy  
and in witness your physical mannerisms and patterns and get in touch with see like from outside of you yourself? Yeah, yeah. So that's very rich to get a glimpse of yourself like that. Because when you get in touch with those tendencies through meditating, they're like, like we're doing. They start to show you when you're, they start to show you you from an experiential place in your life as opposed to having to live through those things that that you may feel guilt over. So it's just been in touch with how you react when you believe the thought and what happens. He's trying to control you. Okay, so close your eyes and look at him. See him just the way it was. Now dry you have a posted on him. It was a sticky posted. Yeah, he's trying to control you right now. Take that posted off. And just who are you without your story? Look at him, hear him. And who are you with? That thought he's trying to control you. What do you see?

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah, that was a great image. I actually looked like the one who was more aggressive in my mind's eye. And he looked like he was trying to have a conversation with me. Yeah, he was much more open.

Chedy  
So there's that thing. You are who I believe you to be in the I am who I believe you to be in the moment. I believe it

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah. starting to make sense. Yeah.

Chedy  
So he's trying to control me turn it around. I'm,

Unknown Speaker  
I'm trying to control him.

Chedy  
So try that

Unknown Speaker  
on. Yeah, I can see that. Even when I was reacting back to him, this you know, this isn't going to work. Maybe Maybe we should end this I kind of knew that was my way of manipulating him. Yeah. I thought though again, the back I dropped the kind of I knew that was

Chedy  
we were up to our trips. We kind of skip over them very quickly, because he's controlling me after all. Yeah. Trying to good luck with that. Yes, so he's trying to control you what is the opposite of control?

Unknown Speaker  
Surrender came to mind, but I can't fit that into the sentence. Allow me

Chedy  
so trial and he's trying to allow allowing

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah, I could see some evidence of that in that moment.

Chedy  
Cuz you see how you are

Unknown Speaker  
right? Yeah. Yeah, and the way that he wanted to have a conversation about it,

Unknown Speaker  
that he actually didn't jump to any conclusions. I was actually at my friend's wedding and reception and we were probably at some of the last people leave

Chedy  
we meaning the two of you. Well, well, he's looking good. Oh my goodness. We don't live with the with when we're not with the person we believed them to be in aware with the person we believe them to be. How strange that sound. It's like saying the same sentence. Hearing it differently. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah.

Chedy  
It's possible for someone to control you Is it true? No.

And how do you react what happens when you believe the thought it's possible for someone to control you?

Unknown Speaker  
It makes me want to distance myself from those people.

Chedy  
Those controlling people and who would you be without the thought? It's possible for someone to control you. Just living your life the rest of your life without the thought

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah, much more open and receptive to people in general.

Chedy  
So let's turn it around. It's possible for someone to control me.

Unknown Speaker  
It's not possible for someone to control me. That feels good.

Chedy  
But it's always been correct. Can you find one time in your life when anyone has ever controlled up now? Not really. And I challenge everyone watching this or all of you in the room. I sure did believe it though. For a long time if someone if someone says button can you drop your hand or I'm going to shoot you? You know your choice that's a Yeah, it's my choice. It's poor attempt the mic drop my hand and see what happens but there's no guarantee there either. So manipulation just becomes an old overused standard.

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah, it really is.

Chedy  
Painful to both parties. Yeah. If he said if you don't drop your hand, I'm going to kill you. And I dropped my hand. Did he control me?

Unknown Speaker  
No.

Chedy  
I made the choice to drop their hands. So why would I blame him for killing me which I couldn't anyway. Thank you, Laurie. Thank you, fun to sit with you. And very empowering

Unknown Speaker  
Thank you. See me?

Chedy  
Right
