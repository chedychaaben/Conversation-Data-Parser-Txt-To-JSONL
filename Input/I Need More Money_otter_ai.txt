INTRO TEXT What happens when we defer our dreams for material things? “If only I had a little more money stashed away, I’d be able to do what I really want.” This way of thinking is nothing more than a construct you’ve relied on in order to stay comfortably in the planning stages of your life. When you are able to break free from your constructed reality, you see that the door was open the entire time. Now you have to step through it.

So, Eric, you've experienced the full journey of a worksheet and you witnessed the facilitation. Now this is self facilitation, and I noticed that you had filled it in. So what was that process? Did you pull one out of your head or from your from the judge your neighbor worksheet onto this one?

Unknown Speaker  
I pulled my most pertinent issue.

Chedy  
Excellent. Okay. So, what was the the thought you isolated from the judge your neighbor worksheet and move to this one belief at a time worksheet?

Unknown Speaker  
It was around financial security.

Chedy  
So, what is it you don't have enough money? Yes. Okay, so you don't have enough money. And what did you find? That you sell facilitate

Unknown Speaker  
Is it true? No.

Chedy  
So what happened? You're one of the few people in the entire world that don't believe they need more money

What did you discover? Oh, no, some of us we drop into a depth and we see it's crazy. But it doesn't stop us from wanting more money. So it's, we begin to open to know and then how do you react in that third question when you believe that thought you don't need more money? So it begins to open up the experience of cause and effect, believe suffer, or believe don't suffer? And we get to see what is true for you ultimately, and how you're going to wear it in the world. So what did you find? How do you react? What is the situation?

Unknown Speaker  
The situation was I feel incapable. When I feel like I don't have enough money and then the emotions that arose with distress, shame, low self worth, inability to survive inability to thrive.

Chedy  
Yeah, so that's pretty scary. Yeah, that's really scary, but we're in that dream. And we are convinced now to go more deeply into the way you answered this. Something happens for you to be fearful. When you believe the thought you need more money and you experience what you just described. You see images of past you see images of future remember the movie I was talking about? It's how the mind reacts when it believes the thought. Now you cannot be fearful. If you're not believing what you're seeing in this dream world have not know it's terrifying. So it simply means that egos got you. So let's look at in this moment, you need more money. Is it true? No, no, there's there's there's nothing even for sale here. It's just not true. And if and so just now we're looking at just No. No, notice how you react when you believe that thought you need more money. And we've seen that and so those images of past future what do you see

Unknown Speaker  
in those images? Deaf in a very bad way? Yes.

Chedy  
Yeah. And those who are images of the past may come from movies they come from from parents stories. They come from grandparents stories that come from neighbors stories. And we watch them we've seen them. And it doesn't matter if it's happened to us or not. It's traumatizing. In other words, the egos caught us in that that dream now and then you see images of the future and what do you see?

Unknown Speaker  
It's, it's like it keeps cycling back to the past. The energy keeps getting bold, not

Chedy  
becoming your future. And now, when you are questioning what you're believing the past begins to lose its power. So there's nothing to create a future and that leaves you present. You need more money just here right now. Is that true? Are we producing? No. And so I need more money, turn it around. What's the opposite? I don't

Unknown Speaker  
I don't need more money.

Chedy  
So just tested.

Unknown Speaker  
It feels like relief.

Chedy  
Now you're with your friends and they, they you all want to go somewhere. They all have the money you don't and you don't want to ask them and you know that if you use your credit card, it's maxed out. You know, whatever the scenario is, okay, so you see you maybe you're standing outside the theater, maybe you're standing outside, what would you love to go to a store, okay, so they're all going to buy stuff, okay. And you don't have any money. So now you're in the store, you're watching them, buy all this stuff. They have the money, okay? You don't. Okay? Now let's call that right here right now. So be there now. You need more money.

Unknown Speaker  
Is it true? No.

Chedy  
We should be without your story. Look at their joy. Look at their laughter just become a part and just be a part of all of that. Continue to witness I don't need more money. Now what feels better that are spending money you really don't have.

Unknown Speaker  
I don't need more money feels better. than spending money I don't know. Well

Chedy  
you don't miss anything you gain look how busy they are. And look at the competition and everything from joy to surely should know it's all there to witness just for you. That's how I see live. That's how I see life. I don't have to join people I join people. I see

Unknown Speaker  
there's no poverty when you're joining people in the way you described.

Chedy  
Now move back into I need more money look at the different doesn't,

Unknown Speaker  
doesn't sit anywhere.

Chedy  
Now I invite I invite everyone to find an exception. In other words, a moment in time where you need more money. It does doesn't happen. It doesn't happen. It's a state of mind. And that doesn't mean you won't lose your house. You won't lose your car. It doesn't mean you won't lose your education. It does. That's not it. It's just just notice that Where are you the most empowered with a thought or without. And it's not as though you don't know how to make money. It's not as though you can't

Unknown Speaker  
yeah

Chedy  
know the question is Are you okay? If they take your house they take your car, they take everything without the cut. They need more money. Are you okay? So imagine yourself sitting on the curb and you're watching two people move into your house, the house you loved and they're moving in and they're late love it and you don't even have money for a hotel room. Sitting there. Watch the joy witness the joy and moving in. Yeah. So it's okay to be homeless to anyone I love the world to know that other than what we're thinking and believing. It doesn't matter what terror we're experiencing. Like if someone's got a knife and they you know, they say I'm going to kill you. And I'm going to kill you like they really mean it. Am I okay in that moment? Am I okay? Here's how I'm not okay. If I imagine the future even one nanosecond and imagine it goes hand and what created the fear the knife? The words, or my anticipation of that nanosecond who frightened me was it what was it the person with the knife? Did I do that? Myself? We're not doing this on purpose. But to wake up to reality leaves us in the fear just another way of saying look to yourself. There's nothing terrible has ever happened. Never will happen. It's all this work. will bring you into a kind of stillness. If you bring it into your practice your meditative practice, a kind of stillness and Stephen and I were laughing the other day. We were in London and on and one of those huge buses was coming. And the streets were just we just crowded. And I stepped out onto the street. And everyone was literally gasping and oh my god, oh my god and so fearful there was no danger whatsoever because I'm not crazy. So imagine if I had anticipated the bus what could have happened? Fear would just I wouldn't know where to go. I would just like lean back and enjoy the wind. It was heavenly. So this practice can give you a present that is really user friendly. And where other people are lost you can be seen or make poor decisions when we're fearful. So that went from money to a lot of things didn't. So what did you like about it? Or what did you find confusing or when you were sitting alone with your one belief

Unknown Speaker  
the hardest part was the full willingness to be honest with myself in a public space. So humiliation was like the first obstacle had to overcome and stigma and shame and all of the things around sharing what's difficult for me. That was and then I kind of moved through it and wanted to be with experience to do it to be deliberated, essentially, you know, stronger than the desire to remain. Keep the facade

Chedy  
being said you have a sense of where you're going who's one just move through the fear any anxiety.

Unknown Speaker  
You see what tennis games Yeah, like there's more abundance than there is obstruction of, and so it's like the flow was stronger than that and so you know. Yeah.

Chedy  
So people would call that courage. Thank you. Aaron.

Unknown Speaker  
Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  
No thank you.
